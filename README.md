My name is Ivan Innocent Sekibenga. These are lecture materials i have authored to teach an undergraduate topic on data wrangling in R for the module called  "Statistical Computing in R" at Kyambogo University.
One file is a pdf of lecture notes or handout.
The next file is an R-markdown with the R code used.
Lastly, i also share the excel data file called "Employees.xlsx".
