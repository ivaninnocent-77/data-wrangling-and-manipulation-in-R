My name is Ivan Innocent Sekibenga. These are lecture materials i have authored to teach an undergraduate topic on data wrangling in R for the module called  "Statistical Computing in R" at Kyambogo University.
Some files are pdfs of lecture notes or handout.
Other files are R-markdown files containing R code.
Lastly, i also share the excel data file called "Employees.xlsx" used for data wrangling and manipulation in my lecture notes.
